Player: What is this place…? It’s hard to even grasp where I am right now. #line:00c45a6
Bunny: You have transcended to the astral realm, a place in between higher dimensions when you left your physical body. #line:033da53
Bunny: I was formed when you entered this space. All I know is that I am here to help you. That is why I was brought here. #line:099f69a
Player: My stuffed bunny is talking to me… I’m trapped in this strange place… I want to know what’s going on! #line:0aa4ca3
Bunny: Well standing here isn’t going to get us anywhere. #line:0fe7c43
Bunny: It’s best we get our bearings around here and find out as much as we can about this place. Now hop to it. #line:0812653

My best friends would always tell me that I’m a kind-hearted person. #line:087b2bd
They felt that they could trust me. It made me really happy… #line:0356dee
I’ve always tried to talk honestly to people, but I try to be sensitive at the same time so I don’t hurt their feelings. #line:09f994e
I don’t really talk or stand out that much, but I don’t want to be hated. #line:0540df4
It feels really nice when I do talk to someone. That’s why I want to be as kind and sincere to them as possible. #line:0c2e997
When I go back home… I want to try to talk to more people… Slowly but surely… Thank you. #line:095af74

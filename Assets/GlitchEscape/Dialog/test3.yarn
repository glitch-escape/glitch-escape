    This place is the anchor point of this world. 
    It’s tethered to all sorts of different parts of this realm through the portals here.
<<elseif $curMsg % 4 eq 1>> 
    I do not remember when those people got here. It is strange.
<<elseif $curMsg % 4 eq 2>> 
    That orb in your possession… I can see it resonating around you.
<<else>>
    This realm is deeply connected with you. 
    The more you explore this realm, you might learn new things about yourself.
